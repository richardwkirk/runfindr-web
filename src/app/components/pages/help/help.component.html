      <h2>parkrun data</h2>
      <p>runfindr.uk is not associated with the parkrun organisation.</p>
        
      <p>The site loads parkrun data from the parkrun websites. The data is loaded on demand through a runfindr.uk server
        acting as a proxy. The data is reformatted and presented in maps and athlete trump cards. No parkrun data is stored 
        by runfindr.uk other than in internal caches used to reduce network traffic. These caches are cleared regularly.</p>

      <p>runfindr.uk does not store your personal data. The local browser storage on your device will remember your search
        history and athlete data you have previously viewed. This is only stored locally only and not on the runfindr.uk server. 
        You can clear your local storage to remove any runfindr.uk data history.
        Our server logs will track what requests for data are made to the parkrun website as these requests are routed through runfindr.uk servers. 
        No data returned from the requests will be held on the server. We only record which pages were requested and when.
